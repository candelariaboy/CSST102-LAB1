# "Uses of Machine Learning in Different Fields"

**Overview:** Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that concentrates on creating algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. ML systems enhance their performance by analyzing patterns and insights within extensive datasets, rather than relying on predetermined instructions. This allows them to adapt and improve over time, making them suitable for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

## Diagnostics that Predictive in Healthcare

* **Problem Being Solved:**

**In Healthcare Systems** - Machine learning is making remarkable advancements in the healthcare sector, enhancing both diagnostics and treatment processes. ML models are capable of predicting patient outcomes by analyzing historical data. For example, they can identify patients who are at a higher risk of developing conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, which allows for timely interventions and tailored treatment plans.

 In this example, a decision tree classifier is used to infer from a dataset if a patient has diabetes or not.
